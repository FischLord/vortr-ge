### Slide 9: **Conclusion and Questions**
**Jacob:**

- "Alright, let's conclude our presentation with a summary of the key points we discussed today."
- "First, we explained why monitoring is critical in IT systems."

**René:**

- "Next, we covered the different types of monitoring such as Network, Performance, and Security monitoring."
- "We also reviewed some popular tools like Nagios, Zabbix, Datadog, Prometheus, and Splunk."

**Janneck:**

- "Then, we discussed the key features you’d expect from monitoring tools, including real-time monitoring, alerting, data visualization, log management, and performance metrics."
- "We also talked about real-world use cases where monitoring is essential."

**Jacob:**

- "Finally, we explored future trends in monitoring, especially the role of AI in making monitoring more efficient and accurate."

**René:**

- "Now, we'd like to open the floor for any questions you might have about monitoring."
